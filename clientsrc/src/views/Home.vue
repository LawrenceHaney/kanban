        <p class="align-self-end text-center">Originally implemented by Toyota in the 1940’s, Kanban fulfillment looked to provide demand based supply chains. By using cards to cue individuals of the larger needs of the team, members were empowered to collaborate efficiently. Taking inspiration from how customers interact with supermarkets, Kanban looks to provide process necessary components as required by their next step applications.</p>
